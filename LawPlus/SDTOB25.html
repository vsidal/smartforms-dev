                <div class="section-1">
                    <p>
                        This document sets out the terms of the relationship between you, the Client and us, your Solicitor, and contains certain information that we are required to provide to you at the start of your claim. This document is subject to the Non&dash;Contentious Business Agreement that we have made with you, and which takes priority over these Terms of Business. We have tried to make the information as clear as possible and it is vital that you read the document carefully and fully understand and agree its contents. We do appreciate that you may like us to clarify certain points and if there is anything you would like us to explain, please do not hesitate to contact us. These terms contain provisions which limit our liability to &pound;3 million. We refer you to the limitation of liability set out below.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Nature of our agreement to provide legal services to you</h3>
                    <p>Our agreement with you to provide legal services is a non&dash;contentious business agreement within the provisions of section 57 of the Solicitors Act 1974.</p>
                    <h3>No claims to be made against individual directors, partners, and employees of the firm</h3>
                    <p>Subject to the qualification set out below, no director, partner, or member of staff of LawPlus Solicitors will have any personal liability for work undertaken for you. You agree not to bring any claim personally against any individual director, partner, or member of staff in respect of any loss which you suffer or incur, directly or indirectly, in connection with our services. This will not limit LawPlus Solicitors&apos; own liability for its acts or omissions. This provision is intended to benefit such directors and members of staff, who may enforce this clause pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>
                    <h3>Liability to persons who are not the client of LawPlus Solicitors</h3>
                    <p>Subject to the qualification set out below, we shall have no liability to any parties except you and any third parties to whom our advice is expressly addressed.</p>
                    <h3>Our liability limited to &pound;3 million</h3>
                    <p>Subject to the qualification set out below, our liability for losses arising out of, or in connection with, our retainer (including legal costs you incur in pursuing recovery of the losses and including interest) shall be limited to the sum of &pound;3 million in respect of any claim against us.</p>
                    <p>In defining what a claim is for the purposes of this clause, all claims against us arising from one act or omission, one series of related acts or omissions, the same act or omission in a series of related matters or transactions, similar acts, or omissions in a series of related matters or transactions, and all claims against us arising from one matter or transaction, shall be regarded as one claim.</p>
                    <h3>Proportionate liability</h3>
                    <p>Subject to the qualification set out below, if we are jointly, or jointly and severally, liable to you with any other party we shall only be liable to pay you the proportion of your losses which is found to be fairly and reasonably due to our fault. We shall not be liable to pay you the proportion which is fairly and reasonably due to the fault of another party.</p>
                    <h3>Effect of limitation or exclusion of liability you agree with another person</h3>
                    <p>We could be affected by any limitation, exclusion, or liability which you agree with another of your advisers or any other third party in connection with a matter on which we are acting for you. This is because such a limitation or exclusion of liability might also operate to limit the amount which we could recover from that other person, for example by way of contribution. Subject to the qualification set out below, you agree that we shall not be liable to you for any increased amount thereby payable by us, or for any amount which we would have been entitled to recover from another of your advisers or other third party by way of indemnity, contribution or otherwise, but are unable to recover because of that limitation or exclusion of liability.</p>
                    <h3>Qualification to limitation of liability</h3>
                    <p>Nothing in these Terms of Business excludes or restricts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Liability below the minimum level of cover required by the SRA Indemnity Insurance Rules from time to time. The amount of such minimum level of cover as at August 2012 was &pound;3 million for an LLP or limited company&bsemi;</li>
                        <li>Liability for death or personal injury caused by breach of duty&bsemi;</li>
                        <li>Liability for losses caused by the fraud, dishonesty, wilful default, or reckless disregard of professional obligations committed by any partner or member of staff within the course of practice or from liabilities which cannot be limited or excluded by law or by rules of professional conduct in force from time to time&bsemi;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We believe the limitations on our liability we have set out are reasonable having regard to the likely level of the loss we would cause to you if we incur a liability to you, and the availability and cost of professional indemnity insurance and possible changes in its availability and cost in the future. But should you consider them inappropriate we invite you to discuss the limits with us and we will then investigate the options with you, including the option of providing further cover at additional cost.</p>
                    <h3>Severance</h3>
                    <p>Each of the limitations set out above constitutes a separate and independent limitation so that if one or more are held to be invalid for any reason or to any extent whatever or does not accord with any professional obligation, then the remaining limitations or the limitations as varied shall be valid to the extent they are not held to be invalid or incompatible with any professional obligation.</p>
                    <h3>Who Regulates us&quest;</h3>
                    <p>The Solicitors Regulation Authority regulate us. The professional rules relating to solicitors&apos; firms, including the Code of Conduct, can be accessed on the website of the Solicitors Regulation Authority at www.sra.org.uk/code&dash;of&dash;conduct.page</p>
                    <p>Under an exemption from direct authorisation from the FCA, we are permitted to advise on and arrange non&dash;investment insurance policies, specifically After The Event (ATE) Insurance for which we offer a product from a single Insurer. We only recommend insurance cover provided by companies with whom we have made contractual arrangements. We do not conduct an analysis of the insurance market.</p>
                    <p>Our firm holds professional indemnity insurance and, should you so request, we will provide you with the name and contact details of our professional indemnity insurer, and details of the territorial coverage of the insurance.</p>
                    <h3>What does our Service Cost&quest;</h3>
                    <p>As our Client, you are responsible for our charges, and they form part of your claim against the other party. To ensure that you are protected in respect of costs, we have discussed and agreed with you the best method of funding these charges, and the method by which your legal costs are being funded is confirmed in our covering letter to you.</p>
                    <p>At this stage, we believe that your claim has good prospects of succeeding. However, if we become concerned at any stage that your claim might not succeed, we will contact you straight away.</p>
                    <h3>Complaints</h3>
                    <p>In any circumstance where we do seek payment of our charges from you, you are entitled to make a complaint to us about the firm&apos;s bill, in accordance with our complaints procedure. There may also be a right to object the bill by making a complaint to the Legal Ombudsman, and/or by applying to the court for an assessment of it under Part III of the Solicitors Act 1974.</p>
                    <p>Please note that the Legal Ombudsman may not consider a complaint about the bill if you have applied to the court for assessment of the bill.</p>
                    <p>Claims often involve time limits, particularly once legal proceedings are commenced, and there is a limitation period in place which provides a deadline by which your claim must be pursued. Your co&dash;operation at all times will help to ensure your claim is progressed without delay. Failure to respond to our requests for co&dash;operation and information may result in us ceasing to act on your behalf.</p>
                    <p>Subject to your cancellation rights, if you instruct other solicitors in relation to the matter in which we are acting for you, at any time after we have commenced work on your file and before, then we have the right to keep all of your papers unless you pay all our charges and expenses due at that time or another solicitor working for you undertakes to pay us what we are owed.</p>
                    <p>LawPlus Solicitors aims to deliver a first&dash;class service every time. We realise however that things can sometimes go wrong and we welcome complaints as an opportunity to improve our service. If something is wrong, we will do our best to put it right. If you do need to make a formal complaint about our service, we invite you to contact us as outlined below and we will acknowledge your complaint and confirm how it will be dealt with.</p>

                    <p>We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. You may be entitled to compensation from the scheme if we cannot meet our obligations.

For compulsory classes of insurance, insurance advising and arranging is covered for 100% of the claim, without any upper limit. Further information about compensation scheme arrangements is available from the FSCS on 020 7892 7300 or by visiting www.fscs.org.uk</p>

                    <p>For example, if you recover &pound;10,000 in compensation and the percentage is 25&percnt;, then you will pay us a fee of &pound;3,000 including VAT.</p>
                    <p>Another example, if you recover &pound;4,500 in compensation and the percentage is 28&percnt;, then you will pay us a fee of &pound;1,512 including VAT.</p>
                    <p>If you end the agreement or we end it because you have not kept to your responsibilities, or you, die we become entitled to charges calculated on a different basis. Our charges are based on the time we spend dealing with your claim, and this includes reading and working on correspondence, emails, telephone calls and any meetings with you. The complexity of your case will also affect the time spent on it. Our charging rate is &pound;300.00 per hour. This is a rate which applies whichever grade of fee earner, whether a qualified solicitor or not, works upon your case. It is a blended rate, which reflects the fact that unqualified staff are often charged out at lower rates and senior solicitors are charged out at higher rates. You agree that you approve this rate.</p>
                    <p>You are of course free to &quot;shop around&quot; for alternative solicitors who might charge you a lower percentage rate, or hourly rates. Our charges are reviewed annually and may be increased from time to time. We will let you know if there is any change during the time that we are dealing with your claim.</p>
                    <p>We will also incur disbursements which are fees that we have to pay to other parties or expenses.</p>
                    <p>We will require you to pay for your disbursements in advance. If your case is lost, you would then not recover these items of expenditure.</p>
                    <h3>VAT</h3>
                    <p>Under current HM Revenue &amp; Customs Regulations, if you are a company, business or individual who is registered for VAT, you are responsible for any VAT on your legal costs. This is not recoverable from the person at fault, and we will submit to you a VAT account. Please note that VAT will also not be recovered from the person at fault in relation to repair costs, hire charges, etc. incurred by you. If, however you are not registered for VAT then it will be reclaimed from the person at fault or their insurers on your behalf.</p>
                    <h3>Professional Duty</h3>
                    <p>As a firm of solicitors, we have a professional duty to always act in your best interest and give you independent advice. There is nothing in our relationship with any referrer of business that would compromise or impair this duty or our independence. Information disclosed by you will not be disclosed to your referrer unless you consent &dash; please refer to the Confidentiality section of this document. If you require any further information, please contact us.</p>
                    <h3>Your Papers</h3>
                    <p>We operate a paperless environment, and all correspondence and documents are scanned into an electronic file upon receipt. Personal documents that you send to us will be returned to you by return post and all other paper correspondence will be destroyed once scanned.</p>
                    <p>Once your claim is settled your electronic file will be archived and the record retained for a period of 10 years before being securely destroyed. If after your file is archived, you require copies of any papers we hold, a small charge may apply for retrieving the papers.</p>
                    <h3>Your Right to Cancel</h3>
                    <p>Under the Distance Selling Regulation, if you were first contacted by us by telephone and verbally agreed to use our service, you have a right to cancel your instructions to us within fourteen days of the date of this letter by writing to us and telling us you wish to cancel your claim.</p>
