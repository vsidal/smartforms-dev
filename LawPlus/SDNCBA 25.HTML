Out of the money you agree to let us take first our share of the money. You take the rest.</p>            
            <div class="doc-row">Billing you</div>
            <p>We will send you requests for payment on account of disbursements as the claim progresses. We will send you a final statute bill of our fees at the conclusion of your claim.</p>

            <p>You have a right to have our final statute bill assessed by the Court under section 70 of the Solicitors Act 1974. Strict time limits apply for you to make any application for such an assessment.

            <div class="doc-row">Death</div>
            <p>This Agreement automatically ends if you die before your claim is concluded. We will be entitled to recover our fees from your estate. Your estate is then liable to pay us for the work we have done on your claim at an hourly rate of £300 per hour for each hour of work we have done. You agree to pay us for routine letters or telephone calls lasting less than 6 minutes at 1/10th of the hourly rate. If they take longer they will be charged at the appropriate proportion of the hourly rate. VAT will be added to this sum. If your personal representatives wish to continue your claim we may offer them a new non-contentious business agreement.</p>
            <div class="doc-row">What happens after this Agreement ends</div>
